# Release Notes

## Description
This page describes the different changes and updates in each version of Platypus.
Platypus includes two sets of PIC simulators: py-platypus, a pure Python
implementation used for understanding the underlying physics, and Platypus, which
is written in C++ and written for performance.

The naming scheme for each release is `a.b-x.y` where:

* `a` is incremented for signficant new Platypus features
* `b` is incremented for minor feature changes or bug fixes for Platypus
* `x` is incremented for signficant new py-platypus features
* `y` is incremented for minor feature changes or bug fixes for py-platypus

## Releases
